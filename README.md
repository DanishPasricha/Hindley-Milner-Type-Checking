# Hindley-Milner Type Checking
 
The goal of this project is to give you experience in Hindley-Milner type checking. 
We begin by introducing the grammar of our language which is based on the previous project with additional 
constructs. Then there wll be discussion of the semantics of our language and type checking rules.
